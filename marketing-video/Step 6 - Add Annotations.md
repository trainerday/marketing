# Step 6: Add Annotations in Final Cut Pro

Add final annotations, titles, and polish to your video using Final Cut Pro.

## What You'll Do:

### 1. Import the Generated Video
- Open Final Cut Pro X
- Import `current-project/final-output/final_video.mov` into your project
- This is your base video with overlays, music, and voice already mixed

### 2. Add Annotations and Enhancements
Add any additional elements you want:
- **Callout boxes** - Highlight important UI elements
- **Text overlays** - Add explanatory text or emphasis
- **Arrows and shapes** - Point to specific features
- **Lower thirds** - Add your name/title if needed
- **End cards** - Subscribe buttons, related videos, etc.
- **Color correction** - Adjust if needed
- **Additional transitions** - Between chapters if desired

### 3. Final Review
- **Watch the entire video** - Check timing and flow
- **Verify audio levels** - Ensure voice and music balance is good
- **Check overlays** - Make sure title and logo overlays work well
- **Test on different devices** - Preview how it looks on mobile/desktop

### 4. Export for YouTube
When you're satisfied with your annotations:

**Export Settings:**
- Format: **QuickTime Movie**
- Video Codec: **ProRes 422** (or H.264 for smaller file size)
- Resolution: **1920x1080** or higher
- Frame Rate: **30fps** (match your source)

**Save Location:**
```
current-project/human-provided-content/ready_for_youtube.mov
```

## Tips:
- Keep annotations **simple and clean** - don't overwhelm the viewer
- Use **consistent styling** - Same fonts, colors, animation timing
- **Preview frequently** - Scrub through timeline to check timing
- **Less is more** - Only annotate what adds real value

## Troubleshooting:
- If FCPX won't import the video, try converting to H.264 first
- If audio seems out of sync, check your project frame rate matches the source
- For large files, consider ProRes Proxy for editing, then export to ProRes 422
