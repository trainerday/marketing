Date: 2025-07-10

The video, "TrainerDay Feature Update: New Plan Duration Picker," introduces a new update on TrainerDay that focuses on streamlining Coach Jack's workout duration methods. The new feature presents a daily workout duration range, allowing users to start at a minimum time for the first week and gradually increase to a maximum time by the last week. This enhancement aims to simplify the plan creation process and accommodate users' time constraints, as opposed to the previous method which required dealing with complex weekly hours or schedules. 

The main benefits of this update include flexibility and adaptability in workout lengths, with the provision of a range that increases each week. This method accommodates days requiring fixed workout lengths while also offering a progressive plan that fosters fitness and performance improvement. The video underscores how this strategy is key to facilitating adaptations without the need for excessive intensity. 

The key functionality showcased in the video is the Plan Duration Picker that is designed to make the plan creation process simpler, faster, and more tailored to user needs. The tool exhibits the principle of volume progression as a fundamental way to increase performance, as suggested by most good coaches. The video concludes by encouraging users to try out the new feature on TrainerDay, emphasizing its potential to improve the user experience significantly.
