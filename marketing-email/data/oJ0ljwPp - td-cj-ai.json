The better they match the better the plan will match you.  All our plans are good and will cause long term progress although some can be overly hard we try to avoid assigning those by default but if that is what you want you can have it.  If you can handle bigger suffering and it is safe for you, you will likely see short term rapid progress doing more intensity.  Long term continual gains are better via a more balanced approach.\n\nWe should tell the users some important stuff to pay attention to.\n\n1. We recommend starting with a 12 week base plan which will be low intensity.  If you don’t want this change the tag Periodization: BaseOk to Base Not Ok\n2. We believe you like moderate workouts and have assigned you a workout difficulty range of Moderate but since you are starting base it will be easy and build to moderate.\n3. We have set your periodization to 3 month cycles of base, build and peak.

I can train about 5 hours a week. I sleep about 7.5 hours a night. I don't want to train too hard right now but want to ease into harder training soon because I don't feel I recover very quickly now if I do much intensity. No health issues that would affect my cycling but I am 58 and been inconsistent in my training so don't recover as well as possible. I am very inspired and active right now though.\n\nNow when N/A or blank comes back on some of the required fields we should then ask a follow up question.  i.e.  “Can you provide a list of which days you can train on and any any daily or weekly time limitations.”\n\nI need to update this schema.  Really we should ask all the stuff CJ asks for questions now including setting all limits.  We optionally could let people define their own list of blocks and block lengths for example.","id":"68404ad1aaa0e7c99a220912","name":"Example First Prompt","idShort":21,"shortLink":"MmvGmiF3"},"board":{"id":"669a34c6f73e45db90280b48","name":"TD-CJ Ai","shortLink":"oJ0ljwPp"},"list":{"id":"683ea75435df5db5ccf747e9","name":"Priorities"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2025-06-04T15:09:32.243Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"6032a320b9f924b4b36edc996f3375b8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d/6032a320b9f924b4b36edc996f3375b8","fullName":"avanlaningham","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"A","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Alex VanLaningham","initials":"AV","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"avanlaningham"}},{"id":"684060e44045faaf4a7f1121","idMemberCreator":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","data":{"attachment":{"id":"684060e44045faaf4a7f10fb","name":"profile_schema.json","url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/68404ad1aaa0e7c99a220912/attachments/684060e44045faaf4a7f10fb/download/profile_schema.json"},"card":{"id":"68404ad1aaa0e7c99a220912","name":"Example First Prompt","idShort":21,"shortLink":"MmvGmiF3"},"list":{"id":"683ea75435df5db5ccf747e9","name":"Priorities"},"board":{"id":"669a34c6f73e45db90280b48","name":"TD-CJ Ai","shortLink":"oJ0ljwPp"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"addAttachmentToCard","date":"2025-06-04T15:06:12.639Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"6032a320b9f924b4b36edc996f3375b8","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d/6032a320b9f924b4b36edc996f3375b8","fullName":"avanlaningham","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"A","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Alex VanLaningham","initials":"AV","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"avanlaningham"}},{"id":"68405cd0af331ff4ad8d53a0","idMemberCreator":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","data":{"old":{"desc":"See below.

Overall they will have their original answers and incremental updates, although they will be able to start over and we show their original choices and they can over write those but I think it is still a good idea to retain the history as over time we can see how people evolve and eventually make AI much smarter.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"avanlaningham+2iealhft2qc2redwl19+34ky9j30i6dssvr5gr0+0dkcwelnnh@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"669a34c6f73e45db90280b48","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"683ea75435df5db5ccf747e9","idMemberCreator":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"5e45affa6a94c8552f48779d","idShort":13,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":true,"name":"CJ - Update Questions","nodeId":"ari:cloud:trello::card/workspace/5e45affa6a94c8552f48779d/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c","pinned":false,"pos":140737488371712,"shortLink":"H3HKdzf0","shortUrl":"https://trello.com/c/H3HKdzf0","singleInstrumentationId":null,"sourceEmail":null,"staticMapUrl":null,"start":null,"subscribed":false,"url":"https://trello.com/c/H3HKdzf0/13-cj-update-questions","cover":{"idAttachment":null,"color":null,"idUploadedBackground":null,"size":"normal","brightness":"dark","idPlugin":null},"isTemplate":false,"cardRole":null,"mirrorSourceId":null,"mirrorSourceNodeId":null,"attachments":[{"id":"683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636","bytes":328555,"date":"2025-05-30T11:38:34.195Z","edgeColor":"#17191a","idMember":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","isMalicious":false,"isUpload":true,"mimeType":"image/png","name":"image.png","previews":[{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63b","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63b","scaled":false,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63b/download/image.webp","bytes":866,"height":50,"width":70},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63c","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63c","scaled":false,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63c/download/image.webp","bytes":2498,"height":150,"width":250},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63d","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63d","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63d/download/image.webp","bytes":2738,"height":167,"width":150},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63e","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63e","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63e/download/image.webp","bytes":7146,"height":335,"width":300},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63f","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63f","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d63f/download/image.webp","bytes":21756,"height":669,"width":600},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d640","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d640","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d640/download/image.webp","bytes":61516,"height":1338,"width":1200},{"id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d641","_id":"683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d641","scaled":true,"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/previews/683998bbb8f9a9823ee6d641/download/image.webp","bytes":113584,"height":2074,"width":1860}],"url":"https://trello.com/1/cards/6839987a9c022be4f2eb7b0c/attachments/683998bab8f9a9823ee6d636/download/image.png","pos":16384,"fileName":"image.png"}],"pluginData":[],"customFieldItems":[]},{"id":"685991536ca1b1ed040cd2a8","address":null,"badges":{"attachments":0,"fogbugz":"","checkItems":0,"checkItemsChecked":0,"checkItemsEarliestDue":null,"comments":0,"description":true,"due":null,"dueComplete":false,"lastUpdatedByAi":false,"start":null,"externalSource":null,"attachmentsByType":{"trello":{"board":0,"card":0}},"location":false,"votes":0,"maliciousAttachments":0,"viewingMemberVoted":false,"subscribed":false},"checkItemStates":[],"closed":false,"coordinates":null,"creationMethod":null,"creationMethodError":null,"creationMethodLoadingStartedAt":null,"dueComplete":false,"dateClosed":null,"dateLastActivity":"2025-06-24T07:40:50.267Z","dateCompleted":null,"dateViewedByCreator":null,"desc":"So after asking the users questions.

I can train about 5 hours a week. I sleep about 7.5 hours a night. I don't want to train too hard right now but want to ease into harder training soon because I don't feel I recover very quickly now if I do much intensity. No health issues that would affect my cycling but I am 58 and been inconsistent in my training so don't recover as well as possible. I am very inspired and active right now though.\n\nNow when N/A or blank comes back on some of the required fields we should then ask a follow up question.  i.e.  “Can you provide a list of which days you can train on and any any daily or weekly time limitations.”\n\nI need to update this schema.  Really we should ask all the stuff CJ asks for questions now including setting all limits.  We optionally could let people define their own list of blocks and block lengths for example.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"avanlaningham+2iealhft2qc2redwl19+34lyvuoxdzc8483dq8i+1ns1neg8uz@boards.trello.com","externalSource":null,"idBoard":"669a34c6f73e45db90280b48","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"68441ce682c90b4e11610261","idMemberCreator":"53afd578c5fed45d87d0877d","idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"5e45affa6a94c8552f48779d","idShort":21,"idAttachmentCover":"68404ad45a8a7ac79b6fa86f","labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"Example
