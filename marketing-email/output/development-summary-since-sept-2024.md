    I can't believe it's been 285 days since our last update! I've been heads-down with the team, obsessing over every detail to make TrainerDay the best it can be. Your patience and continued support mean everything to us.

    The Bluetooth connectivity update? That came directly from YOUR feedback. The performance improvements? Because YOU told us where things felt sluggish. This isn't just our app - it's yours, and we build it together.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 16px; color: #555; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-style: normal; line-height: 1.6;">
    Keep the feedback coming. Seriously. I read every email, every forum post, every review. It's how we know what to build next.
