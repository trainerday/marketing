<h1>No power meter on your bike? No problem. Heart rate based training is the new fashion trend.</h1>
<p >Power meters are great especially for short duration higher intensity intervals. But they are not a necessity for training smarter or getting faster. I would argue that many riders would be better off focusing on heart rate. I say this partially because it has been shown that easy rides are a corner stone of performance. Easy and heart rate based training go hand in hand. I would also argue that learning to judge your hard intervals by RPE (rate of perceived exertion) is a valuable step in cycling performance.</p><figure><img  data-width="1200" data-height="528" alt="Garmin heart rate monitor cycling" src="/images/blog/2024-03-0fHcGTdsvE4Tmx55l.jpg"></figure><p >As recently popularized, there are 3 primary training zones or intensity targets. Easy, moderate and hard. Arguably, breaking it down farther than this is not a critical component to getting faster. Most people do too much moderate and not enough easy and hard. You can google “Polarized Training” to get a better understanding of this.</p><p >So you can use TrainerDay to execute your heart rate based training.
