MRC, ZWO and ERG files support ramps.</p><p ><strong>TrainingPeaks and Garmin do not support ramps.</strong></p><p >So TrainerDay has an algorithm that automatically converts ramps to steps trying not to produce just the right number of steps.</p><p ><strong>The problem with Garmin</strong></p><p ><strong>Garmin only supports up to 50 steps. </strong>Generally, this conversion works great but Garmin only supports up to 50 steps total so you have to factor this in when trying to push workouts to Garmin. A workout like the one at the bottom of this page can not be pushed to Garmin. The ramps just increase the number of steps more. Workouts must be simplified.</p><figure><img  data-width="962" data-height="611" src="/images/blog/2024-03-07edHXRV-WnnvSkUH.png"></figure>
