<p >In the beginning of TrainerDay it was called ERGdb, a free, simple cycling workout sharing platform. When I was creating blog posts there was “a kid” commenting on these posts. I liked this kid “Samoramobile,” and thought I could help him on his cycling journey.</p><p >Between Samoramobile’s excitement and username I was sure he must be a young kid from Asia. As our relationship continued, I found out he did not need my cycling guidance. He was a retired pro-racer from Portugal 😀. Talk about being wrong. 🙈</p><p >Last year Samoramobile’s son Pedro started cycling a lot more, and this year he started racing. I want to congratulate Coach Joã (Samoramobile) and Pedro. If Pedro did not get a flat tire he in a key race he would have qualified for “The Worlds.”</p><figure><img  data-width="1770" data-height="2150" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1yrJKN9D3emlVHXX4K6kF-w.png"></figure><p >Joã has been a strong supporter of TrainerDay and he let me know he exclusively used Coach Jack’s training plans to help his son achieve this level of success.</p><p ><strong>Pedro’s 2022 Summary:</strong></p><p >1° Place Elite/M São Mamede Mediofondo</p><p >2° Place Elite/M Mediofondo Médio Tejo</p><p >8° Place Elite/M Gerês<br>Mediofondo</p><p >9° Place Elite/M Mediofondo Serra da Estrela</p><p >40° Place Elite/M UCI World Series Mediofondo Coimbra Region (bad look with a flat tyre)</p><p >2023 The future only God knows…</p><p ><strong>Here is exactly what Joa sent</strong></p><figure><img  data-width="1002" data-height="852" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1P1FBVcebwpHxgEe1WxOqvA.png"></figure><p >Congratulations once again to both Coach Joã and his son Pedro.
