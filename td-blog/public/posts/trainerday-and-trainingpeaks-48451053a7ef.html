<h1>TrainerDay and TrainingPeaks</h1>
<h3 >Using TrainerDay workouts in other apps and devices</h3><p >One of the easiest ways to use TrainerDay workouts is to create a free TrainingPeaks account and connecting that to Rouvy, TrainerRoad, Zwift, Wahoo or a lot of other apps. Once you do this you come to TrainerDay connections page under settings and you can connect to TrainingPeaks.</p><figure><img  data-width="1400" data-height="772" src="/images/blog/2024-03-0bb6opA-UpeVi9Gta.png"></figure><p >Once this is done the rest is easy. Just find any workout or plan and send it to TrainingPeaks. With plans you should have a Premium TrainingPeaks account or the whole plan will go on a single day. But one easy thing to do is each day you want to train. Find your workout and click send to TrainingPeaks and in 30 seconds or less you can see it in they training platform of your choice.</p><figure><img  data-width="1400" data-height="801" src="/images/blog/2024-03-0_Ea78aE9khMEDcp7.png"></figure><p >Other options for using TrainingPeaks are what is called WOD.
