<h1>Garmin — Send to Calendar</h1>
<h3 >For Free Accounts</h3><p >You can send directly to Garmin Connect for free. Send to Garmin Library allows you to go to Garmin Connect and push your workouts to your device. We have always sent Garmin 3s (3 second power target), so this is also unchanged. If you upgrade you get these additional options.</p><figure><img  data-width="282" data-height="300" src="/images/blog/2024-03-0RY2qHvSJl4KnW5rQ.png"></figure><h3 >Send to Garmin Calendar</h3><p >Go to a workout and click Send To &gt; Garmin you will see this popup. You must have a paid membership. The great advantage of sending directly to your Garmin calendar is you don’t have to go to Garmin connect app or site to push the workout to your device. It will now just show up on your device automatically. One less step!!!</p><p >If you don’t have a paid membership. Please help support us.
