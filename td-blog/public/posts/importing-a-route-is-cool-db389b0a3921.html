<h1>Importing a Route</h1>
<p >This is a very simple import process, if your route has power it will show you the same targets you have. If it does not have power it will give simple power estimates but this is not made for optimizing route performance. It also shows the same slopes.</p><h4>Importing routes have three key features.</h4><p ><strong>Number One:</strong> If you ride a route outdoors, you can download it as TCX or GPX and assuming you have a power meter and power data when you import it you can ride it as ERG mode in many apps. We will add FIT file import soon.</p><figure><img  data-width="856" data-height="840" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1dVRLJrpMNc2IMhnCL-BYJg.png"></figure><p ><strong>Number Two:</strong> If you find or create a route using google maps, RidewightGPS, strava routes or your friends maps, you can download the GPX or TCX and import WITHOUT power data and we will create power estimates for ERG mode. Now I would not say this is overly accurate as people ride hills all kinds of different ways, but as you go from 0% to 20% slope grade, you will find the power target getting harder and harder.</p><p ><strong>Number Three — The coolest feature.</strong> Is slope mode in our app (coming soon). If you want to ride the same slopes, similar to training effect as right hills in Zwift, but without the cartoons we will automatically convert elevation changes into slopes. When we add this automatic slope mode in our app, you can go in and out of slope vs ERG automatically. We and many others feel that for sprinting on an indoor trainer slope mode is superior. ERG does not allow for dynamic sprinting. We will add a video and more information about this soon on this page. We expect this to launch in September 2021.</p><p >This feature is not good for TT race pace planning. I mean if you did a route previously and like the powerout put you did, sure you could repeat this and get good at it, but taking a route and using our power estimates will not produce anything useful for TT race pace. You should use Best Bike Split tool for that but it is complicated and you should have a pretty good idea of your aerodynamic drag to use it (cDA).</p>
