<h1>Introducing the TrainerDay Simple Calendar</h1>
<p >Our calendar is focused on simple but flexible training. You can easily add a week, delete a week, add workouts from your library or add Coach Jack or other training plans.</p><figure><img  data-width="2546" data-height="1494" src="/images/blog/2024-03-18SnBAi6C3v2DH1eRk92ocw.png"></figure><p >You can sync this calendar to Garmin and Training Peaks, which is especially valuable if you use our Coach Jack plans. You can quickly edit your CJ plan in the plan builder and it will automatically re-sync to where you need it. Also you can read <a  href="https://blog.trainerday.com/no-power-meter-on-your-bike-no-problem-heart-rate-training-b901c7a11c06" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but converting workouts to HR instead of power is a breeze as well.</p>
