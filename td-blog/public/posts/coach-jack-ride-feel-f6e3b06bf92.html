<p >Coach Jack workouts are designed with 4-parts. Warm-up, main work, secondary work and cool down. We have a new feature called “Ride Feel.”</p><figure><img  data-width="1229" data-height="399" src="/images/blog/2024-03-0TiezPrZS0i_JY7WQ.jpg"></figure><p >We have now added the option to adjust your “ride feel.” Often the secondary work, especially when starting a new plan, is the longest part of the workout. The main work is to drive specific adaptions but the secondary work is to build training fatigue and aerobic capacity. Some people want harder workouts, some want easier feeling workouts. Ride feel gives you the ability to adjust the main stress (TSS) of the workout without affecting the primary main work adaptions.</p><p >See below.</p><figure><img  data-width="1334" data-height="926" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1NdkD86dcHkGGQZg7McKewA.png"></figure>
