<h1>The Ultimate Way — Zone 2 Training</h1>
<p >The TrainerDay mobile app now has the ultimate way to do heart rate based training.</p><figure><img  data-width="1920" data-height="1080" alt="Zone 2 Heart rate with automatic power adjustments" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1jUvTsuYQsVWtGz8afOWK1g.jpg"></figure><p >This feature is similar to ERG mode. You set your target heart rate and just pedal your power will be automatically adjusted to keep you at your target heart rate.</p><figure><img  data-width="1006" data-height="1782" alt="Heartrate training mode. Perfect for Zone 2" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1EbQuHyEgyQD-730R4hJUuA.png"></figure><p >Once you know your target heart rate your daily workout takes as little as 6-seconds to get started.</p><ol ><li >Click on quick start in the TrainerDay training app</li><li >Make sure your heart rate monitor and smart trainer are connected</li><li >Click on HR mode</li><li >Start pedalling</li><li >Click + — in our app to set your target</li></ol><p >So that is the easiest part. Just like determining your FTP. For Zone 2 training you should do a test to determine your target heart rate. If you prefer to keep it simple to start with you can can just train at 65% of your maximum heart rate and you can start training. You don’t need to do anything else. But keep reading if you want to set everything up “perfectly.”</p><p ><strong>Percent of maximum heart rate vs percent of threshold heart rate.</strong> Above I suggested 65% of maximum heart rate. If you don’t know your maximum heart rate I provided a test you can do below.</p><p >But our app is designed so that heart rate works similar to power based training so we suggest you start by setting your threshold heart rate in our app.</p><figure><img  data-width="1006" data-height="574" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1nlCxbl9XpKz-wSEQUlwG8g.png"></figure><p >Threshold heart rate is the same heart rate that you have when going as hard as you can for about 40 minutes. Because accuracy <strong>does NOT affect your training</strong> it does not need to be perfectly accurate but will improve your experience a little by setting the right scaling in our app. Also at the bottom we show your target % of threshold rather than your target of maximum heart rate. If you have your threshold heart rate set accurately. You can just set your target to 80% and that should be a reasonable Zone 2 target as well.</p><p ><strong>The best way to determine your target Zone 2 heart rate</strong></p><figure><img  data-width="1172" data-height="568" alt="Zone 2 Heart Rate test using ERG mode on a smart trainer" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1lwv9_NqmII0sExACjPhegA.png"></figure><p >Here is a link to that workout.

You must adjust your gearing and pedal as hard as you can.</p><p ><a  href="https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/maximum-heart-rate-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.trainerday.com/workouts/maximum-heart-rate-test</a></p><figure><img  data-width="2504" data-height="760" src="/images/blog/2024-03-1TFrgQ6US9V-x3oQt0HgHgA.png"></figure><p >A video describing this process and going into more depth.</p><div >
